# Character display

As the name suggests a display that can show characters.

the name of the display usually have two numbers, for example 16x2 or 20x4.

This is a reference to the number of characters and lines on the display.

the display usually have a fixed background color and a parallel data interface. this means that more wires are required in order to control it than if it had a serial interfac, like for example I2C.

I2C-expanders exist that will allow you to use fewer pins. both variants have libraries available so you can easily write things on your new display.
