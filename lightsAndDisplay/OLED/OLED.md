# OLED display

The 'O' is for 'Organic'. yes, bio-something-something.

This type of display is super cools since each pixel will act like it's own little LED. this means that contrast is crazy high.

The downside is that lifetime is limited. or at least it was back in the days. Also, if your project is not turned un 24/7 you should be good.

Most of these small displays have an I2C interface and thus is just a connector for your board: VCC,GND,SCL and SDA. the rest is in a library for the microcontroller.
