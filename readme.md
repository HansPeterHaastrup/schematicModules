# Schematic modules

How to use:

The idea of the schematic modules is to be able to get a quick overview of what is needed to be inserted in order for the components to work.

The information on each module is available from the main part datasheet but each module will try to bring forward the most needed information in a simple and user-friendly package.

The Modules are created using KiCAD but would transfer fairly straightforward to other programs if need be. Modules are only schematics and thus the layout guidelines will still need to be followed for parts that have critical paths in them.

## Types of modules

The modules are usually for a specific function and we're trying to keep them into categories so it's easier to fingure out the blocks you need. the following list is the categories of modules so far

1. [Power blocks](powerBlocks.md)

2. [Signal conditioning](signalConditioning.md)

3. [Special functions](specialFunctions.md)
