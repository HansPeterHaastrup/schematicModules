# Rectifier

Ah. The old rectifier. It's been around since forever but it still does a great job.

So, you have an AC voltage which swings both positive and negative. This rectifier is called a 'Full bridge' rectifier, since it will turn the negative side of the AC signal into a positive side.

This process however, creates a noticeable voltage dip so to smooth out the drop you want to add a quite large capacitor to the output. A 1000uF polarized capacitor usually does the trick but if you can make it larger it's even better.
