# Power blocks

* [Rectifier](rectifier/rectifier.md) - for turning AC voltage into DC voltage

* [Regulator](LDOLDO.md) (LDO) - for turning a DC voltage into a lower voltage

* [Switching regulator](switchingRegulator/switchingRegulator.md) (Buck) - Same as the LDO but more efficient

* [Reverse polarity protection](reversePolarityProtection/reversePolarityProtection.md) - If you are afraid of plugging it in wrong
